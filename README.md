# Methods


## LoadReport method

Load a report from NEMO and return this as pandas dataframe

```python
from nemo_library import NemoLibrary

nl = NemoLibrary()
df = nl.LoadReport(report_guid="b82cfed8-81a7-44e0-b3da-c76454540697")
```

### project_id

Optional parameter. If you want to get reports for non-default ERP projects. Please provide the project GUID (you can retrieve them by running getProjectList)

### report_guid

This methode takes 1 mandatory parameter, the report_guid. You can find "your" guid in NEMO meta data. Just open the definition of the report in meta data and copy the GUID from your browser URL.

The report "(SAMPLE) Replenishment Time Analysis Purchased Parts" for example has this URL: https://enter.nemo-ai.com/nemo/metadata/report/b82cfed8-81a7-44e0-b3da-c76454540697 and thus the GUID you need is then "b82cfed8-81a7-44e0-b3da-c76454540697"

### max_pages

By default all pages from the report are loaded. You can optionally restrict the amount of data by providing max_pages parameter and you'll get not more than this number of pages (usually 1 page holds 20 records)

## ReUploadFile method

ReUpload a CSV file into an existing project

```python
from nemo_library import NemoLibrary

nl = NemoLibrary()
nl.ReUploadFile(projectname="21 CRM", filename="./csv/hubspot.csv")
```

## getProjectList method

Return list of projects (as pandas Dataframe)

```python
from nemo_library import NemoLibrary

nl = NemoLibrary()
df = nl.getProjectList()
```

## ProjectProperty method
